# techBuddy API
### Upload Images and Videos to Cloudinary

## Description
The techBuddy project is a simple Spring Boot project that makes API endpoints that give the user ability 
to upload media files, namely, images and videos to the Content Management Platform - [Cloudinary](https://www.cloudinary.com).

The API stores the media file's metadata but the actual files are saved on the [Cloudinary](https://www.cloudinary.com) platform.

## Setup
To work with this project you only need JDK 17. I think without maven it would still work since there are
the maven wrapper files. You would also need good internet connection inorder to resolve the dependencies
needed for the project.

After the dependencies have been resolved you can run the main class.

## More
There is also an Entity Relationship Diagram and Data Flow Diagram in the repository.
